# Java Programming 1  
**From Syntax to Skill: A Real-World Java Learning Journey**

---

## üö© What This Repository Is

**Java Programming 1** is a curated, classroom-tested collection of Java practice modules that transforms theory into hands-on coding fluency. This is not a random set of drills‚Äîeach task is part of a deliberate progression, blending concise explanations with real problem-solving, so you can move beyond memorizing syntax and start building solutions that matter.

## üéØ Why This Exists

Too many learners get stuck at ‚Äúknowing Java‚Äù but never reach ‚Äúusing Java to solve real problems.‚Äù This repository was built to close that gap. Every module is designed to help you internalize core concepts, then immediately apply them to challenges inspired by real competitive programming and software development scenarios.

## üöÄ Sample Task Showcase

**Task: Unique Characters in a String**  
*Write a method that checks if a string contains only unique characters.*

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
Use a data structure to track seen characters as you iterate.
</details>

```java
public static boolean hasUniqueChars(String input) {
    Set<Character> seen = new HashSet<>();
    for (char c : input.toCharArray()) {
        if (!seen.add(c)) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

**Task: Sum of Even Numbers in an Array**  
*Given an array of integers, return the sum of all even numbers.*

```java
public static int sumEven(int[] arr) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int n : arr) {
        if (n % 2 == 0) sum += n;
    }
    return sum;
}
```
